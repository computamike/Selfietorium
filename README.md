# Selfietorium
A python based photo booth thing, being developed for a wedding November 2017 - will be running using raspberry pi

Photos are template based and support overlays. You can then take multiple photos and composite them within the template.

Actions of the system are driven from the template.  Even the screen prompts used when taking photos.

Fonts
Selfietorium ships with the My underwood font, from Tension Type - My underwood is used in the selfietorium screens, and unless this font is installed, will display using a standard helvetica font.


## Notes
This project uses the Word-wrapped text display module located on the Pygame Code Repository : http://www.pygame.org/pcr/text_rect/index.php by David Clark.

## Packaging issues
Packaging is missing templates folder and sample templates, and the boothconfiguration file.
